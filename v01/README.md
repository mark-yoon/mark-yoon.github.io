<h2> Old Personal Website </h3>

This is the old version of my personal website. I discuss my motivation for switching over to a new website <a href="http://mark-yoon.com/blog/new-look/">here</a>.
Here is the stack that I used:

<h4>The Stack</h4>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Dreamhost server</li>
  <li>Ubuntu 14.04</li>
  <li>Apache</li>
</ul>

Everything was hosted on the cheapest Dreamhost server and the website was run on an Apache web server. I went for a very minialistic look with a centralized color scheme for my old website. I didn't want my website to be... <i>bland</i> so I did my best with font packages (<a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>) and a couple of Jquery libaries for some animations. Overall, I think it came out pretty well. It served its purpose but I had no way to write blog posts.

I ended up ditching this setup in favor of a new stack and platform.
